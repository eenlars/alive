## Getting Value from Personas

### Key Questions to Ask

After generating a persona, use these questions:

| Question | What You Learn |
|----------|----------------|
| "How would they approach this?" | Methodology |
| "What would they focus on first?" | Priorities |
| "What are their non-negotiables?" | Standards |
| "How would they evaluate quality?" | Success criteria |
| "What would they immediately reject?" | Anti-patterns |

### Most Actionable Parts

1. **Red flags** - What they would reject tells you what to avoid
2. **Quality standards** - How they check work defines your bar
3. **Values** - What they care about guides decisions
4. **Approach** - How they think about problems shapes your process

### Applying to Your Work

```markdown
## Persona Guidance for [Task]

### Approach (How They'd Start)
[From persona: how they approach problems]

### Focus Areas (What They'd Prioritize)
[From persona: what they're good at]

### Standards (What "Good" Looks Like)
[From persona: how they check their work]

### Avoid (What They'd Reject)
[From persona: their red flags]
```

---

## Anti-Patterns

| Don't | Why | Do Instead |
|-------|-----|------------|
| Vague query | Poor persona match | Be specific about the task |
| Skip style preferences | Generic result | Define qualities you want |
| Ignore red flags | Miss key insights | Red flags are actionable |
| Just read, don't apply | Wasted persona | Use their standards |

---

## Quick Reference

### Generating a Persona

```
Query: [Specific task you need excellence in]
Style: [Qualities the approach should have]
Context: [Optional project details]
```

### Using the Persona

1. Read their approach and values
2. Note their red flags (what they reject)
3. Apply their quality standards to your work
4. Ask "Would [persona] approve of this?"

### The Core Insight

**The best person for your task isn't always who you'd expect.** The tool picks based on the actual qualities you need, not assumptions about who's famous for what.
