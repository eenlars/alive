# ChatInput Component Rules

## Usage
- Always use compound pattern: `<ChatInput><ChatInput.InputArea />...</ChatInput>`
- Never modify ChatInput internals - extend via composition
- Use config prop for feature flags and limits
- Camera/attachments are optional - enable via config

## File Operations
- Use Read tool before Edit/Write
- Format with `bun run format` before committing
- Test both light and dark mode
- Check accessibility with ARIA labels
